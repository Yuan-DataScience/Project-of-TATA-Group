# Project Title: Sales Data Analysis for Online Retail Store

## Overview
In this project, I worked as a data analyst at TATA Group for a client who operates an online retail store. The client sought to analyze the primary revenue contributors to inform their strategic planning for the next year. The management also intended to expand the business and was interested in examining these metrics from operational and marketing perspectives.

## Situation
The online retail store needed insights into their sales data to identify key revenue drivers and make informed decisions for future strategies. They provided a dataset with approximately 550,000 rows of sales data for analysis.

## Task
I was tasked with analyzing the online retail store's sales data to uncover significant trends and patterns. The goal was to provide actionable insights that would help the management in strategic planning and business expansion.

## Action
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Utilized Excel to clean the dataset according to business requirements.
   - Removed empty values and corrected errors.
   - Added new calculated columns to enhance the dataset for analysis.

2. **Data Visualization**:
   - Connected the cleaned dataset to Tableau for visualization.
   - Created four key visualizations based on client requirements:
     - **Seasonal Trends of Revenue**: Used a line chart to reveal seasonal trends in revenue.
     - **Demands for Products by Regions**: Employed a map plot to display sales across different countries.
     - **Top 10 Countries by Revenue**: Highlighted the top revenue-generating countries.
     - **Top 10 Customers by Revenue**: Showcased the top customers contributing to revenue.

3. **Reporting**:
   - Compiled the findings and visualizations into a comprehensive PowerPoint report.
   - The report was tailored to provide clear insights and actionable recommendations for the management team.
